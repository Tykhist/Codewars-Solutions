If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. 
Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

Kata: Complementary DNA
Rank: 7 kyu
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the 
development and functioning of living organisms. If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". 
Your function receives one side of the DNA; you need to return the other complementary side. 
DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all.
