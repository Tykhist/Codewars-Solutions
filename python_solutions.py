Kata: Printer Errors
Rank: 7 kyu
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which,

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced 
e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as 
a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of 
the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
